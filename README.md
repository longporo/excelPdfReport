# The Final Year Project in Maynooth University
This project involves generating two apps that helps with the automation of part of the final year project (FYP) management process. Specifically:
- <strong>FYP Grading Report Generator</strong>: the automatic analysis and combination of studentsâ€™ grades, from Excel files, into a well-formatted PDF document
- <strong>FYP Descriptions Generator</strong>: the automatic generation of PDF documents containing project descriptions from Excel files

To sum up, both of the two projects are about importing and reading data from Excel files and exporting well-formatted PDF.

The projects are written in Java language and managed with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

This one is the <strong>FYP Grading Report Generator</strong> project.

The libraries used are shown as below.
